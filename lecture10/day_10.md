# Grammer and parsers

languages are formed using grammers

Not all languages can be generated by a grammer.

## Parse trees

The different way to derive a word in a language

parsing problem is to decide whether a word is in a language

There is a one to one correspondence between the values of the haskell type and a parse tree.

the syntax representation doesn't necessarily have semantics and we have to give it one by creating a semantic function

## Approaches to parsing

parser combinators: basically a combination of simpler parsers

There is lexing and parsing

We've used monads to combine parsers.... interesting
