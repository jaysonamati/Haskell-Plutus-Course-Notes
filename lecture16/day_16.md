# Free Monads

## Case study of monad transformers

The notion of sequencing changes with changing the underlying
monad, a notion canonically called "a programmable semicolon"

## Abstracting away specific implementation

The idea is to turn functions into constructors

In practice implementing monad is rarely done by hand, people use either mtl or free.
